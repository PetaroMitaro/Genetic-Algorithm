# A Genetic Algorithm TSP Solver I wrote in high school

This is probably the first real application I ever wrote, and definitely the first machine learning program I wrote. Not that I knew that word at the time...

To run:

    cd bin
    java genetic.algorithm.main

15 year old me does not apologize for the graphics.
